  "description": "<p>This project is meant to replace the simple teleport module I used for a long time. With foundry's new teleport system. Basically what this does is allows a keybinding (default: m)  to do the following:</p><ol><li><p>Set the currently selected tokens to teleport movement.</p></li><li><p>Set the GM's movement mode to unconstrained movement.</p></li><li><p>Move the token to where you're hovering when you press m stacked.</p></li><li><p>Set the selected tokens back to their original movement mode and the GM's movement settings back to whatever they were prior to the process starting.</p></li></ol><p>It will have a button on the left-hand side to enable and disable it so you don't do this unintentionally.</p>",
